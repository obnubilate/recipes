Ingredients for Bulletproof Coffee
At least 1-2tbs unsalted grass-fed butter.
1-2tbs of Brain Octane™ or XCT oil™ (these are 18x and 6x stronger than coconut oil, with no flavor. They are NOT generic MCT oil, which is about 1.6x stronger than coconut oil)
1-2 cups (~250-500ml) of hot coffee brewed with low-toxin beans (like Bulletproof Upgraded Coffee) using a metal filter (like french press or gold filter drip).
5 Steps To Make Bulletproof Coffee
#1 Make Coffee:

Brew coffee as you normally would.  Make sure it’s the right kind of coffee.  If you haven’t purchased Bulletproof Upgraded Coffee beans, read this post to find the best coffee in your area. Use a metal filter if possible.
#2 Pre-heat blender:

Boil extra water and pour it into a blender while your coffee brews to pre-heat the blender.
#3 Froth:

Dump out the hot water from the now pre-heated  blender and add the brewed coffee, butter, and Brain Octane™ oil.  Blend  until there is a thick layer of foam on top like a latte. The stronger the blender, the better. A spoon won’t work.
#4 Optional:

Add cinnamon, vanilla, dark chocolate,  or a sweetener like Stevia, erythritol, or xylitol (this is technically a sacrilege if you use awesome beans, but some people love their mocha…)
#5 Enjoy:

Put on a satisfied look and enjoy the high performance buzz from your creamy mug of Bulletproof Coffee as you watch your chubby, tired coworkers eat low-fat yogurt and twigs for breakfast.  It’s almost unfair.
Oh, and what’s the catch?  You will have no excuse for not getting things done now that you’re powered by Bulletproof Coffee.
